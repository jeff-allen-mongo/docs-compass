     - Name of the MongoDB replica set to which you want to connect.

   * - :guilabel:`Read Preference`

     - Specifies how Compass directs read operations. Options are
       ``Primary``, ``Primary Preferred``, ``Secondary``,
       ``Secondary Preferred``, and ``Nearest``. See `Read Preference <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/read-preference/>`_.

     - Select whether Compass should connect to the target host via
       TLS/SSL or not. Select:

         `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?jmp=docs>`_.

       - :guilabel:`Server Validation` to have Compass validate the
         identity of the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. If selected,

            * - *Certificate Authority File*

              - One or more certificate files from trusted
                Certificate Authorities to validate the
                certificate provided by the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
                instance.

       - :guilabel:`Server and Client Validation` if the
         :binary:`~bin.mongod` performs certificate validation from its
         clients and to have Compass validate the identity of the
         :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. If selected, you must provide

            * - *Certificate Authority File*

              - One or more certificate files from trusted
                Certificate Authorities to validate the
                certificate provided by the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
                instance.

            * - *Client Certificate*

              - A TLS/SSL certificate to present to
                :binary:`~bin.mongod` to verify the identity of the
                Compass client. Typical file extensions for the
                certificate are ``.crt`` or ``.pem``.

            * - *Client Private Key*

              - A TLS/SSL key file to :binary:`~bin.mongod` to
                verify the identity of the Compass client.
                Typical file extensions for the private key are
                ``.key`` or ``.pem``.

            * - *Client Key Password*

              - If the *Client Private Key* is protected with a
                password/passphrase, you must provide the
                password/passphrase.

       - :guilabel:`Unvalidated` to use TLS/SSL without any identity validation.

       .. tip::

          For production use, your MongoDB deployment should use valid
          certificates generated and signed by a single certificate
          authority. You or your organization can generate and
          maintain an independent certificate authority, or use
          certificates generated by a third-party TLS/SSL vendor.
