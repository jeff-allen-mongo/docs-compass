    When you open |compass-short|, an initial connection dialog
    appears:

    .. figure:: /images/compass/connect-to-host.png
      :figwidth: 626px

    .. tip::

       MongoDB Compass can detect whether you have a MongoDB
       :manual:`URI connection string </reference/connection-string>`
       in your system clipboard and auto-populate the connection
       dialog using the URI.
       
       Open MongoDB Compass with a URI connection string in your clipboard and click :guilabel:`Yes`
       when prompted to auto-populate the dialog.

    Select the appropriate tab based on how you are connecting |compass|
    to your database:

         - id: unencrypted

       system.
