  .. note::

     This plugin is already packaged with |compass|, so following
     this tutorial and creating this plugin will not change Compass' visual
     contents. The source code for this plugin is maintained
     by the |compass| development team{{repo}}.

     This tutorial illustrates how to create and display a
     :ref:`header item <plugin-ref-header-items>` in |compass| so you can
     employ a similar approach when adding your own header items.
