.. note::

   :ref:`Compass Isolated Edition <compass-isolated>` restricts network
   requests to :abbr:`TLS (Transport Layer Security)`-encrypted
   :abbr:`TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)` connections to the server
   chosen on the :ref:`Connect <connect-run-compass>` screen. All other
   outbound connections are not permitted in this edition, meaning no
   additional firewall configuration is required when running Compass
   Isolated Edition.
