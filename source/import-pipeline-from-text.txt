You can import aggregation pipelines from plain text into
the :ref:`Aggregation Pipeline Builder <compass-agg-builder>` to
easily modify and execute your pipelines. Importing a plain text
aggregation pipeline shows how each stage of the pipeline
affects the output, and illustrates the effects of modifying specific
pipeline stages using the Pipeline Builder's :guilabel:`Output` panes.

Syntax
------

The imported pipeline must be in the
:manual:`MongoDB query language </tutorial/query-documents/>`
(i.e. the same syntax used as the ``pipeline`` parameter of the
:manual:`db.collection.aggregate()
</reference/method/db.collection.aggregate/>` method). The imported
pipeline must be an array, even if there is only one stage in the
pipeline.

Procedure
---------

.. include:: /includes/steps/import-pipeline-from-text.rst

Once you import your pipeline, you can add and modify individual stages
and see the results reflected in the :guilabel:`Output` of each respective stage.
