Query Bar
---------

From the various Collections tabs, you can use the query bar to specify
MongoDB queries. These queries are executed as ``find`` operations (i.e. not
aggregation). For details, see :ref:`querying`.

.. note::

Documents Tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /images/compass/query-bar-documents-view.png
   :figwidth: 780px

From the query bar in the :guilabel:`Schema` tab, you can specify the
query filter. If you click the :guilabel:`Options` to expand the query
bar, you also have access to the ``project``,``sort``, ``skip``, and
``limit`` options of the query.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 85

   * - ``Filter``

     - Filter for the schema view.
   * - ``Project``

     - The projection to determine the fields to return (``<field>:
       1``) or the fields to exclude (``<field>: 0``).

   * - ``Sort``

     - The sort order of the returned documents. To specify
       ascending order for a field, specify the field and ``1``
       (i.e. ``<field>: 1``). To specify descending order for a
       field, specify the field and ``-1`` (i.e. ``<field>: -1``).

   * - ``Skip``

     - The number of matching documents to skip before returning
       documents.

   * - ``Limit``

     - The upper limit for the number of documents to return.

Schema Tab
~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /images/compass/query-bar-schema-view.png
   :figwidth: 730px

From the query bar in the :guilabel:`Schema` tab, you can specify the
query filter. If you click the :guilabel:`Options` to expand the query
bar, you also have access to the ``project`` and ``limit`` options of
the query.

Click :guilabel:`Analyze` to execute the filter and view the schema.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 85

   * - ``Filter``

     - Query filter for the schema view.

   * - ``Project``

     - The projection to determine the fields to return
       (``<field>: 1``) or the fields to exclude (``<field>: 0``).

   * - ``Limit`` 

     - The upper limit for sampling. The maximum limit is 1000.

Explain Plan Tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /images/compass/query-bar-explain-view.png
   :figwidth: 732px

From the query bar in the :guilabel:`Explain Plans` tab, you can
specify a query filter:

Click :guilabel:`Explain` to view the results of the plan.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80

   * - ``Filter``

     - Filter for the explain plan.

.. _querying:

Using the Query Bar
-------------------

Query Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can type MongoDB queries into the query bar. In the filter
expression, you can use the various MongoDB :manual:`query operators
</reference/operator/query/>` except for the :query:`$text` query
operator.

.. tip:: 

   In the :doc:`Schema </schema>` tab, you can also use the Query
   Builder to enter a query into the query bar. For details, see
   :ref:`build-query`.

As you type, the :guilabel:`Apply` button is disabled and the
:guilabel:`Filter` label turns red until a valid query is entered.
Filter syntax requires strict :manual:`extended JSON
</reference/mongodb-extended-json/>` types. For instance, to specify an
``ObjectID``, use the format ``{ "$oid": "<string>" }``
as in the following filter example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id": { "$oid": "58eee4f43d1a10a4e5339aac" } }

When you have entered a valid MongoDB query, the :guilabel:`Filter`
label is no longer red and :guilabel:`Apply` button is enabled. 

Projection
~~~~~~~~~~

If the query bar has the :guilabel:`Project` option, you can specify
which fields to return in the resulting data. By default, all fields
are returned.

To set projection, click :guilabel:`Options` and enter in the
projection document:

- To include fields, specify the field name and set to ``1`` in the
  project document. For example:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { year: 1, name: 1 }

  Only the fields specified in the project document (and the ``_id``
  field if it is not set to ``0`` in project document) are returned.
 
- To exclude fields, specify the field name and set to ``0`` in the
  project document:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { year: 0, name: 0 }

  All fields except for the fields specified in the project document
  are returned.

.. note:: 

   With the exception of the ``_id`` field, you cannot specify both
   field inclusion and field exclusion in the project document. With
   the ``_id`` field, you can specify its exclusion in a project
   document that specifies field inclusions. For example, 
   ``{ year: 1, _id: 0 }``.

Sort
~~~~

If the query bar has the :guilabel:`Sort` option, you can specify the
sort order of the returned documents.

To set the sort order, click :guilabel:`Options` and enter in the sort
document:

To specify ascending order for a field, set the field to ``1`` (i.e.
``<field>: 1``) in the sort document. To specify descending order for a
field, set the field and ``-1`` (i.e. ``<field>: -1``) in the sort
documents. For example, the following sorts results first by ``year`` in
descending order, and within each year, sort by ``name`` in ascending
order.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { year: -1, name : 1 }

Skip
~~~~

If the query bar has the :guilabel:`Skip` option, you can specify the
first n-number of document to skip before returning the result set. To
specify the number of documents to skip, click :guilabel:`Options` and
enter the number to skip.

Limit
~~~~~

If the query bar has the :guilabel:`Limit` option, you can specify the
maximum number of documents to return. To specify the limit, click
:guilabel:`Options` and enter the limit.

Run the Query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click the :guilabel:`Apply` button to run the query and view the
updated results. These queries are executed as
:method:`~db.collection.find` only (i.e. not aggregation).

.. include:: /includes/extracts/query-bar-results.rst

To clear the query bar and thes results of the query, click the
:guilabel:`Reset` button.
