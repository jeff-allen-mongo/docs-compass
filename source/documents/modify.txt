.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

Select the appropriate tab based on whether you are viewing your
documents in List or Table view:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: List View
      :tabid: list-view

      To modify a document, hover over the document and click the pencil
      icon:

      .. figure:: /images/compass/edit-doc.png
        :figwidth: 696px

   .. tab:: Table View
      :tabid: table-view

      To modify a document, hover over the document and click the pencil
      icon:

      .. figure:: /images/compass/table-view-modify.png
         :figwidth: 696px

After you click the pencil icon, the document enters edit mode:

.. figure:: /images/compass/edit-doc2.png
  :figwidth: 740px

You can now make changes to the fields, values, or data types
of values.

.. tip::

   For the field values, you can paste valid JSON that can be parsed by
   JavaScript's ``JSON.parse``.

   - If the pasted JSON is an Array, the first character must be a left
     bracket ``[`` and the last character must be a right bracket ``]``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        [ "first", "second", 3 ]

   - If the pasted JSON is an Object (i.e. a document), the keys must
     be quoted in double quotes and are permitted to be escaped. The
     first character must be left curly brace ``{`` and the last must
     be right curly brace ``}``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        {
          "email": "test@example.com",
          "phone": "555-555-1212"
        }

Delete Fields
-------------

You can delete fields by selecting the ``x`` icon to the
left of the field:

.. figure:: /images/compass/edit-doc3.png
  :figwidth: 740px

Once selected, the field is marked for removal and appears
highlighted in red:

.. figure:: /images/compass/edit-doc4.png
  :figwidth: 740px

Add New Fields
--------------

To insert a new field, click or tab to the end of the document and
fill in the field/value. New fields appear highlighted in green:

.. figure:: /images/compass/edit-doc5.png
  :figwidth: 740px

To add a new field for the document, hover over the row number in the
dialog (the row number is not part of the document but the dialog
display) and click on the plus sign add a new field after the field.

You can also add a new field at the end by clicking the Tab from the
value of the last field.

.. tip::

   To add a new field after an array or a document field, hover over
   the row number in the dialog (the row number is not part of the
   document but the dialog display) and click on the plus sign add a
   new field after the field.

Modify an Existing Field
------------------------

You can modify documents by clicking on existing field names or
values and making changes. In this example, the flight status was
changed from ``L`` to ``M``. Changed fields appear highlighted in
yellow:

.. figure:: /images/compass/update-field.png
  :figwidth: 740px

When you are finished editing the document, click the ``Update`` button
to commit your changes. Compass performs a ``findAndModify`` operation
to update the document.

Revert a Change
---------------

While modifying a document, you have the option to revert changes made to a
field prior to saving the modified document.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: List View
      :tabid: list-view

      To revert changes to a document in the
      List View, hover over the edited field
      and click the :guilabel:`revert icon` which appears to the left of the
      field's line number.

      .. figure:: /images/compass/revert-doc-list-view.png

   .. tab:: Table View
      :tabid: table-view

      To revert changes to a document in the
      Table View, click the :guilabel:`revert icon` which appears on the 
      right side of the edited table element.

      .. figure:: /images/compass/revert-doc-table-view.png

Cancel Changes
--------------

To exit the edit mode and cancel all pending changes to the document,
click the ``Cancel`` button.
